<div><p>The core module, ui.grid, contains only the core features needed.  More complex features are separated into feature modules and must be included in your application module.</p>

<p>You must include each feature as a dependency for your application module.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
angular.module('yourApp', ['ui.grid', 'ui.grid.feature1', 'ui.grid.feature2']);
</pre>

<p>Each feature directive must also be included in alongside the ui-grid directive.  This allows you to have many grids in an application and enable certain features for each grid instance.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;div ui-grid="gridOptions" class="grid" ui-grid-feature1 ui-grid-feature2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>
