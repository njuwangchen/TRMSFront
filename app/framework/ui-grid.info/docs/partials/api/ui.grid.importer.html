<p>This module provides the ability to import data into the grid. It
uses the column defs to work out which data belongs in which column, 
and creates entities from a configured class (typically a $resource).</p>

<p>If the rowEdit feature is enabled, it also calls save on those newly 
created objects, and then displays any errors in the imported data.  </p>

<p>Currently the importer imports only CSV and json files, although provision has been
made to process other file formats, and these can be added over time.  </p>

<p>For json files, the properties within each object in the json must match the column names
(to put it another way, the importer doesn't process the json, it just copies the objects
within the json into a new instance of the specified object type)</p>

<p>For CSV import, the default column identification relies on each column in the
header row matching a column.name or column.displayName. Optionally, a column identification 
callback can be used.  This allows matching using other attributes, which is particularly
useful if your application has internationalised column headings (i.e. the headings that 
the user sees don't match the column names).</p>

<p>The importer makes use of the grid menu as the UI for requesting an
import. </p>
